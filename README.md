# 📋 To-Do List App

A simple and visually appealing **To-Do List** app built with the **MERN stack**: **Next.js (App Router)**, **React**, **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, and **Node.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

This project demonstrates form handling, backend API integration, persistent task storage using **MongoDB**, and effective state management with React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`. Tasks are stored in a MongoDB database, fetched via an Express API, and displayed in real time on the frontend.
